# Introduction:

## Usage:
If you wish to replicate the experimental results, you can download the released weights here. 

The file naming convention is: ckpts/[datasets]/[missing rate]/[missing type]/[results_epoch=xxx-step=xxx.step]

Checkpoints will be released when the paper be accepted.

## Tips:
Different batch sizes can affect the results. For example, in the open checkpoints folder, some folders contain two sets of results, which represent the different outcomes achieved when the batch size is 8 and 32 respectively. We did not explore more possibilities. Please refer to the article for the parameter settings.
